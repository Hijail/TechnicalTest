# TechnicalTest

## What you’ll build
You’ll pick a Spring guide and import it into IntelliJ IDEA. Then you can read the guide, work on the code, and run the project.

## What you’ll need
About 15 minutes

IntelliJ IDEA

JDK 18 or later

## Installing IntelliJ IDEA
If you don’t have IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition) installed yet, visit the link up above. From there, you can download a copy for your platform. To install it simply unpack the downloaded archive.

When you’re done, go ahead and launch IntelliJ IDEA.

## Importing a Getting Started guide
To import an existing project you need some code, so clone or copy one of the Getting Started guides, e.g. the REST Service guide:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Hijail/TechnicalTest.git
```

With IntelliJ IDEA up and running, click Import Project on the Welcome Screen, or File | Open on the main menu:

IntelliJ IDEA will create a project with all the code from the guide ready to run.
